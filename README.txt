Notes Widget Wrapper wraps your widget in a "sticky note" style box and displays the text in a hand writing style. Although this plugin may work with numerous widgets, it has been developed with the intended use of applying a "sticky note" style to custom HTML content. The built in "Text" and "Custom HTML" WordPress widgets work great with Notes Widget Wrapper.

= How does this plugin compare with WP Notes Widget =

Here are a few key differences between WP Notes Widget and Notes Widget Wrapper:

* WP Notes Widget has more restrictive HTML elements, and a standard order for those elements.
* WP Notes Widget allows you to manage and organize many notes easier than Notes Widget Wrapper.
* WP Notes Widget must display all notes in sequential order.
* WP Notes Widget enforces a standard look for all notes. Notes Widget Wrapper has much more flexibility.
